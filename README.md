## How It Works

### Core Components

1. **Image Grid**
   - Responsive CSS grid that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Each image card has hover effects and transitions
   - Images are filtered based on selected category

2. **Category Filtering**
   - Click on category buttons to filter images
   - State management with React useState hook
   - Smooth transitions between filtered views

3. **Lightbox**
   - Opens when an image is clicked
   - Displays high-resolution version with title and category
   - Navigation controls for browsing through the gallery
   - Keyboard support (arrow keys for navigation, ESC to close)

4. **Animation System**
   - CSS keyframes for entrance animations
   - Staggered delays for a cascade effect
   - Smooth transitions for all interactive elements

### Technical Implementation

- **React Hooks**: useState for state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and styling
- **Next.js**: For optimized performance and routing
- **Lucide Icons**: For UI elements and navigation controls
